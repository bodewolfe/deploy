Super Mario 64 is one of the most iconic and beloved games of all time. It was the first 3D platformer to feature Mario, and it revolutionized the genre with its open-world exploration, dynamic camera, and diverse gameplay. But did you know that you can play this classic game on your PSP for free?
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install an unofficial PSP port of Super Mario 64 made by a fan. This port is based on the source code of the game that was leaked online in 2020, and it runs smoothly on most PSP models. You will need a PSP with custom firmware (CFW) installed, a memory stick with at least 256 MB of free space, and a USB cable to connect your PSP to your computer.

## Step 1: Download the PSP port of Super Mario 64
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the PSP port of Super Mario 64 from this link[^2^]. This is a zip file that contains the game files and a readme file with instructions. You can also check out the source code of the port on GitHub[^3^] if you are interested.
 
## Step 2: Extract the zip file and copy the game files to your PSP
 
After downloading the zip file, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called "sm64-port" that contains two files: "EBOOT.PBP" and "sm64.us.f3dex2e.z64". These are the game files that you need to copy to your PSP.
 
Connect your PSP to your computer using a USB cable and enable USB mode on your PSP. Then, open your PSP's memory stick on your computer and navigate to the "PSP" folder. Inside this folder, create a new folder called "GAME" if it doesn't exist already. Then, inside the "GAME" folder, create another folder called "SM64" (or any name you like). Finally, copy the two game files ("EBOOT.PBP" and "sm64.us.f3dex2e.z64") from the "sm64-port" folder on your computer to the "SM64" folder on your PSP.
 
## Step 3: Launch the game and enjoy
 
Now you are ready to play Super Mario 64 on your PSP. Disconnect your PSP from your computer and exit USB mode. Then, go to your PSP's main menu and select "Game". You should see an icon for Super Mario 64 with a picture of Mario's face. Select it and press X to launch the game.
 
You can use the analog stick or the D-pad to move Mario, and the face buttons to jump, crouch, punch, or grab objects. You can also use the L and R buttons to change the camera angle, and press Start to pause the game. The game has 120 stars to collect across 15 worlds, plus some secret levels and bosses. Can you beat Bowser and rescue Princess Peach?
 
We hope you enjoy playing Super Mario 64 on your PSP for free. This is an unofficial port of the game made by a fan, so it may have some bugs or glitches. If you encounter any problems or have any feedback, you can contact the developer on GitHub[^3^]. Happy gaming!

## Step 4: Discover some secrets and tips
 
Super Mario 64 is not only a fun and challenging game, but also a game full of secrets and tips that can enhance your experience. Here are some of them that you can try on your PSP port of the game:
 
- Find the Cap Switches: In some levels, you can find special switches that activate the Wing Cap, the Metal Cap, or the Vanish Cap. These caps give Mario special abilities, such as flying, walking underwater, or passing through walls. To find them, you need to look for hidden areas or secret stars. For example, to find the Wing Cap Switch, you need to collect 10 stars and enter the painting of a sun in the main hall of the castle. Then, you need to fly to the top of a tower and step on the switch.
- Get unlimited lives: If you ever run out of lives, don't worry. There is a way to get unlimited lives in Super Mario 64. All you need to do is go to Tiny-Huge Island and enter the level from the small painting. Then, go to the area where there is a Koopa Troopa and a Goomba near a pipe. Kick the Koopa Troopa shell and ride it around the area. You will notice that every time you hit a Goomba with the shell, you get an extra life. You can keep doing this until you have as many lives as you want.
- Change the water level for Wet Dry World: Wet Dry World is a level where you can change the water level by touching different switches or crystals. However, there is another way to change the water level without touching anything. The water level in Wet Dry World depends on how high you jump into the painting that leads to the level. The higher you jump, the higher the water level will be. The lower you jump, the lower the water level will be. Try it out and see how it affects your exploration.

## Step 5: Have fun!
 
Super Mario 64 is a game that never gets old. It has so much to offer, from its colorful graphics and catchy music, to its varied gameplay and creative level design. It is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or skill level. Whether you want to collect all 120 stars, speedrun through the game, or just explore every corner of the Mushroom Kingdom, Super Mario 64 will keep you entertained for hours.
