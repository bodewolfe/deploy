Fallout 2 is a classic role-playing game that was released in 1998. However, some players may encounter a frustrating error message when trying to load certain locations or save files. The error message says "The instruction at x referenced memory at y the memory could not be read from" and then crashes the game. This error can prevent players from progressing or completing the game.

- **Install the latest patches and mods.** Fallout 2 has some official patches that fix various bugs and glitches, as well as some unofficial mods that enhance the game and add new features. Some of these patches and mods may also address the memory error issue. You can find them on sites like [No Mutants Allowed](https://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/) or [Mod DB](https://www.moddb.com/games/fallout-2). Make sure to follow the installation instructions carefully and backup your save files before applying any changes.
- **Avoid saving during combat or timers.** Some players have reported that saving the game while in combat or while explosive timers are active can cause the memory error to occur. This may be because the game cannot properly handle the dynamic events and variables that are happening in these situations. To prevent this, try to save the game only when you are in a safe and stable location, and avoid saving over previous slots. You can also use multiple save slots to have backup options in case one of them gets corrupted.
- **Revert to a previous save file.** If the memory error happens when you load a specific location or save file, it may be because that file is corrupted or incompatible with your current game version. This can happen if you have installed or uninstalled patches or mods, or if you have encountered a bug or glitch that affected your game data. To fix this, you can try to load an earlier save file that was made before the error occurred, and then replay from that point. You may also need to delete or overwrite the corrupted save file to avoid loading it again.
- **Check your system settings and drivers.** Sometimes, the memory error may be caused by your system configuration or drivers that are outdated or incompatible with Fallout 2. To check this, you can try to update your drivers, especially your graphics card driver, and make sure they are compatible with your operating system and hardware. You can also try to run Fallout 2 in compatibility mode for Windows XP or lower, and adjust your resolution and graphics settings to match your system capabilities.
